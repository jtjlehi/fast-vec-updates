# Fast Vector Updates

How quickly can you apply a bunch of updates to a vector in rust?

This is the source code and benchmarking for [this blog post](https://jtjlehi.github.io/2024/03/13/fastest-vec-update-on-my-computer.html).

You can run it yourself by using `nix develop` followed by `cargo bench`. I ran
all of the benchmarks on my m1 chip macbook pro, running asahi linux.
